Until I reach a release candidate version of this portion of the project, this readme file is
meant to be a planning scratch doc.

"Twenty Games" means to be a sort of living portfolio of my advancement in understanding of
game development and software development as a whole. Through it I would like each release to 
make accessible the previously-completed game projects.
