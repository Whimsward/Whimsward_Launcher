How do you get things like Air or Spectral? Are they expressions of an Aspect?
They're the result of an Aspect of Binding, where you Bind two different Elements.
When you Bind two Elements, one carries the Material for the aspect, and the other
carries the behavior.
Air, then, is Binding Fire(M) with Lightning(B).
A Rite can hold within it the potential to bestow an Aspect, thus unlocking that
Aspect as an option for the Entity.

But the secret is, if I can't get the "economy" of magic sorted out, I think that the
infrastructure of these as components is useful to me.
Rites are essentially Strategy pattern components or policies that extend the objects
they're loaded into.
